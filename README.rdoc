Creative Writing (or "Write – Pisanie twórcze") - is an app that combines creative writing with association web (based both on research and user imput). It creates place for people interested in writing to exercise and share their stories.
"Words of a day" are based on association web and are supposed to be prompts for writing, and they change everyday. They are supposed to help fighting so called "writing block".
App also has mechanism to enlarge its association web based on user input.
